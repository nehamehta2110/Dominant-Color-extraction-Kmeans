# Dominant-Color-extraction-Kmeans
K-Means Clustering algorithm implementation to extract dominant palette colors in a picture and a new picture is formed, which is built from its predominant shading palettes. A picture contains high intensities of hues, these hues are grouped, and the generated pictures contains only extracted colors

**Implementation**
*The image for color extraction is:*

*Color pallete of dominant hues using k-means:*

*New picture formed with pre-dominance hues:*
